# research-sustainability-storyboard
Research sustainability storyboard hack-idea from the [Software Sustainability Institute's Collaboration Workshop 2020](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw20) (CW20) [#CollabW20](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CollabW20).

## Context
PIs are not always aware of the need to consider sustainability in their workflow. They may not be able respond quickly to reviewers comments because analyses were not done reproducibly. Sustainability is useful throughout the research cycle, from the contact with external areas, such as ethics committees and technical support, to the induction of new lab members and the application of reliable, state-of-the-art methods.

This practice is expected to benefit PIs, labs, the broadest community, and the public at large. 
# Aim 
To create a storyboard for a short video to persuade PIs to lead their research groups into working sustainably.
We want the video to
* make clear that work sustainably is useful for them and their research group even if they donâ€™t do software. 
* articulate the imperativesa and benefits of working sustainably in a way PIs will recognise as directly useful to them in terms of saved time/increased productivity or impact or  research integrity
* Signpost resources for their group members and for themselves.

This campaign informs principal investigators (PIs) of the importance of sustainability in both management and research.
